# PosteriorBasedOCs
Supplementary code for Scalable Design with Posterior-Based Operating Characteristics manuscript

The code files for this manuscript are divided into several groups.

Group 1: create Figure 1 for illustrative example
- 01-code-for-figure-1: processes the Likert data and approximates posteriors for Figure 1
- JAGS_ordinal.txt: model to approximate the posteriors for the ordinal model using MCMC

Group 2: create Figure 2 to visualize the design priors
- 02-code-for-figure-2: takes parameters for the specified design priors and visualizes the induced priors
